A time series forecasting project utilizing prophet and SARIMAX to predict hourly electricity consumption for the ComEd region, with analysis of historical data patterns and seasonal trends to enhance grid management.

Hypothesis/Theories:
1.	Hourly electricity consumption exhibits clear patterns that can be captured using time series analysis methods.
2.	Seasonal components significantly influence electricity consumption, with potential peaks during specific times of the day or year.
Research Methodology/Econometric Model:
•	Data Decomposition: Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
•	Model Selection: Employ SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing to forecast electricity consumption.
